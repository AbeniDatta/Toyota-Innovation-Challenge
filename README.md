# Toyota Innovation Challenge


Toyota Innovation Challenge (jointly held by the Engineering Ideas Clinic at UWaterloo and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada (TMMC)) - Prize Winner in the Machine Learning category

- Employed YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to accurately identify and track the wheels of a car and the car itself, in both stationary and dynamic scenarios, as well as in plain and noisy backgrounds, as per the challengeâ€™s problem statement.

- Utilized critical thinking and problem-solving skills to tackle complex challenges presented during the competition, further honing my abilities to navigate real-world problem-solving scenarios.

- Demonstrated strong presentation and communication skills while showcasing our YOLO-based solution.

- Competed with 35+ teams in a group of 2 showing teamwork and responsibility managing tasks.

- Optimized model performance by fine-tuning YOLO hyper-parameters post-competition, further reducing false positives by ~30% by modifying and adjusting the iou and confidence thresholds.

File "image_and_video_recognition.py" provides the code for object detection on static images or pre-recorded video files.

File "realtime_camera_orbbec_astra.py" provides the code for real-time object detection on a live camera feed.
